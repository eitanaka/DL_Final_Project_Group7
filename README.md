# Generating Photorealistic Images of Dogs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
## DATS 6303 Final Project - Group 7
### George Washington University, Columbian College of Arts & Sciences

## Overview
This project aims to generate realistic dog images using GANs, with a focus on DCGANs and Unit2D diffusers.

## Project Structure
- `Code`: Contains all code files including data preprocessing and model training scripts. (Details in the Code folder)
- `Group-Project-Proposal`: Initial project proposal outlining the objectives and methodology.
- `Final-Group-Project-Presentation`: Presentation slides detailing the project findings and results.
- `Final-Group-Project-Report`: Comprehensive report including detailed analysis, results, and discussions.
- `Individual-Project-Reports`: Contributions and reports from each team member.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To start working with the project, clone it from GitHub using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eitanaka/DL_Final_Project_Group7.git

2. **Run on GPU**:
Ensure your system has a GPU for efficient model training.

3. **Data Loading**:
Use the `StanfordDogImage` class for loading the Stanford Dogs dataset.

4. **Train DCGAN**:
- Modify the constants and `main` function in the `train_DCGAN` script for hyperparameter tuning.
- Update the dataset path as per your local setup.
