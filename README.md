# Generating Photorealistic Images of Dogs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
## DATS 6303 Final Project - Group 7
### George Washington University, Columbian College of Arts & Sciences

## Overview
This repository contains the work of Group 7 for the DATS 6303 Deep Learning course at George Washington University. Our project focuses on creating realistic dog images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly exploring the capabilities of Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) and Unit2D diffusers.
